Conditional Statements in Python

The else and elif Clauses

Now you know how to use an if statement to conditionally execute a single statement or a block of several statements. Itâ€™s time to find out what else you can do.

Sometimes, you want to evaluate a condition and take one path if it is true but specify an alternative path if it is not. This is accomplished with an else clause:

if <expr>:
    <statement(s)>
else:
    <statement(s)>

If <expr> is true, the first suite is executed, and the second is skipped. If <expr> is false, the first suite is skipped and the second is executed. Either way, execution then resumes after the second suite. Both suites are defined by indentation, as described above.
